    "## 0. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of **World Wide Web**'s development during the 1990s, complex search engines capable of filtering vast amounts of public data to deliver relevant information were needed. Early proposed solutions struggled with accuracy, frequently returning useless or irrelevant links that didn't match the user's request. The first algorithm that actually succeeded in this goal was **PageRank**, which is the primary reason behind **Google**'s enormous success. The algorithm quantitatively rates the importance of each webpage, in order to return the most helpful results first.\n",
    "\n",
    "PageRank is a delightful application of **linear algebra**. It represents the web as a graph, in which the webpages are the vertices and the links are the edges. The intuition of the algorithm consisted in giving a certain *importance* to a page not only basing on the number of incoming links (**backlinks**), but also on the importance of the pages where these links come from. This relationship is enclosed in a matrix $A$, called the **link matrix**, where each page's importance score ($x_k$) depends on the scores of its backlinks, weighted by the number of outgoing links on those pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the mathematics point of view, the ranking problem consists in finding an **eigenvector** associated with a unitary eigenvalue for a **column-stochastic matrix**. While using the algorithm, it could be possible to deal with the following problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-Unique Rankings**: if there are disconnected subwebs, the ranking might not be unique;\n",
    "- **Dangling nodes**: pages with no outgoing links (columns of zeros in the raw link matrix $A$) make the system substochastic, causing probability mass leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "PageRank solves this problem by conceptually defining the **Google Matrix** $M$. To ensure stochasticity, the raw matrix $A$ is first adjusted into a stochastic matrix $\\bar{A}$ by linking dangling nodes to all other pages (virtually). Then, the Google Matrix is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M = (1 - m) A' + mS\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$ is the *teleportation* matrix (rank-one matrix with entries $1/n$), and $m$ is the **teleportation probability** ($0 \\le m \\le 1$). In our implementation, we avoid constructing the dense matrix $M$ explicitly; instead, we compute the matrix-vector product efficiently by treating the dangling node mass redistribution and the teleportation term as vector corrections at each iteration step.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the **Perron-Frobenius** theorem explicits, this modification ensures the resulting matrix is positive and column-stochastic and guarantees a unique, one-dimensional eigenspace with a positive eigenvector, providing a stable and unambiguous ranking for the entire web.\n",

    "### 1. Data Loading and Matrix Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `read_dat` is designed to parse the graph dataset and convert it into a column-stochastic sparse matrix $A$, which serves as the core component of the PageRank computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process consists of three key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sparse Matrix Assembly:**\n",
    "    To handle large-scale graphs efficiently, we avoid dense matrix representations ($O(N^2)$ memory). Instead, we construct the adjacency matrix using the **COO (Coordinate)** format, which stores only the non-zero entries (the edges).\n",
    "    The matrix is constructed such that $A_{ij} = 1$ if there is a link from node $j$ to node $i$. Finally, it is converted to **CSC (Compressed Sparse Column)** format, which is optimized for column slicing and vector multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Column Normalization (Stochasticity):**\n",
    "    The raw adjacency matrix contains 1s and 0s. To interpret it as a transition probability matrix, we must normalize the columns so that they sum to 1.\n",
    "    The function calculates the out-degree vector $\\mathbf{d}$ (column sums). For every node $j$ with outgoing links ($d_j > 0$), we scale the column:\n",
    "    $$A_{ij} \\leftarrow \\frac{A_{ij}}{d_j}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This is implemented efficiently using sparse matrix operations:\n",
    "    $$A_{\\text{norm}} = A \\cdot D^{-1}$$\n",
    "    where $D^{-1}$ is a diagonal matrix containing the inverse of the column sums. Nodes with no outgoing links (dangling nodes, where $d_j=0$) are explicitly handled to avoid division by zero, resulting in a zero column."

    "The objective is to compute the PageRank vector $\\mathbf{x}$, which corresponds to the stationary distribution of the Markov chain defined by the Google Matrix $M$. In terms of linear algebra, we seek the principal eigenvector of the matrix $M$ associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda = 1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{x} = M \\mathbf{x}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $M$ is a column-stochastic matrix (columns sum to 1) and is primitive (due to the teleportation/damping factor), the **Perron-Frobenius Theorem** guarantees that this vector exists, is unique, and has strictly positive components.\n",
    "\n",

Mathematically, this causes **probability leakage**: without correction, the total probability mass of the system decreases with each iteration ($\\|\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}\\|_1 < \\|\\mathbf{x}_k\\|_1$), making it impossible to converge to a valid stationary distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this structural issue, we treat dangling nodes as if they possess **implicit links** to all other pages in the network. Specifically, we impose a rule where the probability mass entering a dangling node is not lost, but rather **redistributed** across the entire graph according to the personalization vector $\\mathbf{s}$ (a uniform distribution $1/n$).\n",

    "**Convergence:** The power iteration method converged in **19 iterations** to a residual norm $< 10^{-6}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spectral Interpretation:**\n",
    "The ranking vector $x$ represents the **stationary distribution** of the random walk defined by the Google Matrix $M$.\n",
    "* **Dominant Eigenvector:** Node 1 achieves the highest score ($x_1 \\approx 0.368$). This high **eigenvector centrality** is not merely a function of in-degree (number of links) but of the quality of those links. Specifically, Node 1 receives a directed edge from Node 3 ($x_3 \\approx 0.288$), effectively absorbing a significant portion of the probability mass circulating in the network.\n",
    "* **Flow of Authority:** The hierarchy $x_1 > x_3 > x_4 > x_2$ illustrates the flow of importance: Node 3 acts as a key \"hub\" that transfers authority to Node 1. Node 2, despite being part of the strongly connected component, acts largely as a tributary, passing its mass forward without receiving high-value backlinks in return."

    "    The dataset contains **3189 dangling nodes** ($\\approx 53\\%$ of the graph). In the raw link matrix $A$, these nodes correspond to columns of zeros. Instead of simple re-normalization (which would bias the result towards existing strong pages), our algorithm implements the **standard mass redistribution** method.\n",

    "2.  **Cluster Analysis:**\n",
    "    * **Global Maxima:** The homepage (`www.hollins.edu`) and top-level directories (Admissions, About) dominate the ranking. This is consistent with a \"nested\" website topology where most leaf nodes point back to the root, concentrating the steady-state probability at the top of the hierarchy.\n",
    "    * **Local Traps (Slide Galleries):** We observe a cluster of high-ranking pages related to specific academic slides (e.g., \"Sculpture/sld001.htm\"). These likely form a **tightly knit strongly connected component** (a clique of pages linking to Next/Previous). In a random walk, the surfer gets \"trapped\" in this subgraph for a long time before teleporting out, artificially inflating the local PageRank scores."
